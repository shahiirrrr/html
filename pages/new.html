        Gameplay
        Battlegrounds Mobile India, or BGMI, is a TPP-FPP survival shooter game in which up to 100 players compete in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch in which players compete to be the last one standing. Players can enter the match as individuals or as small groups of up to four.

Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the following seven maps:

Erangel (Themed / Normal)
Miramar
Vikendi
Livik (Themed / Normal)
Karakin
Sanhok
Nusa (New)
Each round, the plane's flight path across the map changes, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground. Players begin with no equipment other than customised clothing options that have no effect on gameplay. Once on the ground, players can search buildings, ghost towns, and other locations for weapons, vehicles, armour, and other items. At the start of a match, these items are procedurally distributed throughout the map, with higher-risk zones typically having better equipment. Finished players can also be looted for their gear. Players can choose to play in first-person or third-person, with each having advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness.
